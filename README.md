# Italian-UNESCO-Sites-Choropleth-Map
This choropleth map is meant to demonstrate in a Red to Blue gradient the concentrations of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Italy by Region. To construct this map, I was able to download a shapefile of the Italian Regions and add a 'UNESCO' property to each region in GeoJSON and entered the number of sites to each respective region's property. I also used an ESRI World Topographic map that provided a bit of a rustic feel to my map without being too over the top. In a further project, I would like to add features to the map to let the user easily access online information, probably the Wikipedia page, of each UNESCO site and region on the map.
